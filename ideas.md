## Ideas List

### 1. Travel Map - Loading Indicator
- **Issue**: No indicator when saving a pin - users don't know the app is working
- **Solution**: Add a "Saving..." message or spinner while the pin is being saved

### 2. Stock Tools - Better Rate Limit Handling
- **Issue**: When Alpha Vantage API limit is reached, error just says "no data"
- **Solution**: Show a clear message that the maximum requests have been reached
- **Research**: Find alternative stock APIs with more free requests

### 3. Rate Exchange - Historical Data Range
- **Issue**: Current APIs only go back ~1 year
- **Want**: Go back 5+ years for historical exchange rates
- **Research**: Find alternative exchange rate APIs with longer historical data

### 4. Roles and Permissions
- **Feature**: Add role-based access control
- **Roles**: Admin and Regular User
- **Admin capabilities**: Add/remove users from the allow list to login
- **Regular user**: Standard access to tools
